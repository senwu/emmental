Changelog
=========

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on `Keep a Changelog`_ and this project adheres to
`Semantic Versioning 2.0.0`_ conventions. The maintainers will create a git tag
for each release and increment the version number found in
`emmental/\_version.py`_ accordingly. We release tagged versions to `PyPI`_
automatically using `Travis-CI`_.

.. note::
    Emmental is still under active development and APIs may still change
    rapidly. Until we release v1.0.0, changes in MINOR version indicate
    backward incompatible changes.
